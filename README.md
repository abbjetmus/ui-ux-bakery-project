<i>Baserat på eran målgrupp så kommer ni behöva motivera era design val.</i>

## Introduction
In this project we will practice UI / UX and apply it to an application. You will work in groups of 3 in the project where you get to decide members. The application will be a cafe online shop (konditori) where the data is predetermined, however, appearance and design are not determined. Your task is to, based on a target group, design and implement the application with strong emphasis on design and UI / UX in mind.

This assignment has a lot of freedom in how you design it. The only thing provided is a very basic backend, just a `db.json` file served with [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). Your goal is to implement a frontend application in Vue or React, your choice.

## Target groups (swedish)
* Små barn + föräldrar
* Pensionärer
* Ungdomar + unga vuxna (15 - 25år)
* Lastbilschaufförer
* Turister på soligt ställe
* Religösa grupper
* Politiker
* Gamers och spelentusiaster
* Botanister
* Akademi och skola
* Djurpark/zoo

## The application

### Overview

The application must be adapted to the target group that you have been assigned.
The application is a bakery shop that will be designed and implemented with UI/UX in mind.

Some requirements:
1. Cakes are presented to the customers.
2. Customers can sign-in/sign-out from the shop.
3. Customers can select cakes and make orders.
4. Staff should be displayed in a nice and appealing way.

### Cakes presentation

Cakes must be presented in a nice way with UI/UX in mind, can be a list or a grid it's up to you.
You might want som short information of the cake in the list then clicking on an item a dialog or a new page with detailed information about the cake might open.

### Sign-In/Sign-Out

De api contains customers with email and password that can be used to sign-in/sign-out users, don't have to setup anything yourself they are predefined. So no sign-up is needed.

### Customers can select cakes and make orders

You might implement a cart that will contain the selected cakes and total price that sums up the price for based on the selected cakes.
A order button should be available that make an API call to add another order to he db.json backend.

### Staff should be displayed in a nice and appealing way.

You should have a section or page where the staff that works on the bakery are presented.

## Backend

Take a look in `db.json`.
The REST api is whatever `npm run start-server` gives you. Basically a CRUD api where you can do GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH and OPTIONS on all collections.

The backend has four collections:

1. `cakes`: a list of cakes that the bakery offers.
2. `staff`: a list of staff that work in the bakery.
3. `customers` a list of customers.
4. `orders`: a list of orders from customers.

### Example of a backend call

`GET localhost:3000/cakes`

**I can recommend installing the Visual Studio extension called Thunder Client to test API calls**
**try it in e.g. Thunder Client, or just post the url into the browser**

## Requirements

- The application MUST be implemented in Vue or React.
- Use any npm dependencies (and dev-dependencies) you want. All dependecies you add (except Vue or React) should be motivated (dev dependecies excluded). Use `documentation.md` for this.
- You are free to use a bootstrap tool to spin upp the application e.g. `Vue CLI` or `Create React App`. However, commits 
- Any description about the project; motivating dependencies you added or design decisions you think is worth mentioning etc. should be placed in a file `documentation.md` in the root of the project.
- Make sure you merged your solution to the `master` branch. If you do work on other branches, that's fine - they don't need to be deleted - but we will not look at them.

## How to get started

You need to have `node` and `npm` installed. Then clone this repository, run `npm install` and get started :)

## How create new database file

- `npm install -g json-server`
- `json-server generate.js`
- press `s` to save a snapshot of the database. After that rename your snapshot to "db.json" then restart the server.

if you want to modify your generator, change generate.js. More info about how to use faker [here](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/).


## How to send in the assignment

The assignement can be checked in to a Github classroom repo that you have been assigned.
